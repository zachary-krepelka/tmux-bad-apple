./bad-apple.tmux

	This is a non-user-facing bash script sourced by
	the Tmux Plugin Manager.  It is a supplementary
	wrapper around view.sh to provide quick access
	to preprepared images and videos via tmux key
	binds.  It must reside at the root of the
	project.

./makefile

	There is no build process for this project.  The
	makefile is supplemental and provided largely
	for demonstration purposes.  It is also used to
	generate the GIFs embedded in the README.

./docs

	This directory contains documentation.

./docs/README.md

	The README introduces the project as a whole but
	skims out on the finer details.  Complete
	reference documentation is embedded into each
	script and accessible via a command-line option.

./docs/DESIGN.md

	This is a makeshift design specification &
	requirements document that I threw together
	before working on the project to map out my
	thoughts.

./docs/project.info

	This file explains what every other file in the
	project is for.  It is input to the Unix tree
	command.

./docs/diagrams

	This directory contains diagrams written in the
	Mermaid markup language.  These render on GitHub
	to show the relationship between the scripts in
	this repository.

./docs/diagrams/core-functionality.mmd

	This diagram demonstrates how the core
	components relate to each other.

./docs/diagrams/gif-generation.mmd

	This diagram demonstrates how the GIF generation
	process works.

./docs/exhibits

	This directory contains GIFs embedded into the
	README file.  These GIFs are programmatically
	generated terminal recordings, and to that end,
	this directory also contains scripts used to
	generate the GIFs as well as intermediate files
	in this process.

./docs/exhibits/playwright.sh

	This is a bash script that aids in the
	programmatic generation of the GIFS.  It is a
	user-facing command-line program, so you can
	pass the -h flag to learn more.  Its input are
	the files with the .script extension, and its
	output are the files with the .cast extension.

./docs/exhibits/recording.tmux.conf

	This is a tmux configuration file used to
	preconfigure the terminal environment for
	recording.

./media

	This directory is used by the makefile to set
	aside a space for images and videos so that they
	do not clutter the root directory.

./scripts

	This directory contains user-facing,
	command-line programs.

./scripts/conv.sh

	This script converts an existing image or video
	into a format that view.sh can understand.

./scripts/view.sh

	This script is the actual image viewer / video
	player.  It only accepts a custom file format
	generated by conv.sh.

./scripts/utils

	This directory contains non-user-facing helper
	scripts that are dependencies to the other,
	user-facing scripts.

./scripts/utils/aspect-ratio.awk

	This script determines the aspect ratio of an
	image given its dimensionality, e.g., 1080x1920
	yields 9:16.

./scripts/utils/aspect-scaler.awk

	This script generates a table of image
	dimensions that are integer multiples of aspect
	ratios.  Desired aspect ratios are provided as
	input with one per line.

./scripts/utils/make-meta.jq

	This script extracts relevant metadata from the
	JSON output of ffprobe.

./scripts/utils/makefile-documenter.awk

	This script is used to generate a help message
	for the makefile.  Documentation strings are
	extracted from each rule's recipe.

./scripts/utils/ppm2tmux.awk

	This script converts a portable pixmap to a tmux
	configuration file.  It is a core component of
	this project.

./tools

	This directory contains third-party binaries.

./tools/ia

	This is the internet archive command-line
	utility.  It is used in this project for
	downloading media from the internet archive.
